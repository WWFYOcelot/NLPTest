Need to change text format to separate locations, tags, & data
Have tags influence data processing somehow?

Steps:
1. identify any data pre-processing we'd like to do
2. identify which techniques we'd like to apply
3. tune model(s) to produce best result

1. Need to identify context. Need to see which NLP tools are best for this. Possibilities:
    a. Masked language models: These predict a masked word based on sentence context. We use this by masking the 'disaster' word, and seeing if the model will predict a disaster or not.
    b. Contextual word embeddings: Used in BERT, ELMo
    c. Transformer models, like BERT or GPT
    d. Recurrent Neural Networks
    e. N-grams: capture local context by looking at a fixed number of adjacent words ; since we aren't using long sentences, this could be useful.
2. May need different word processing? Need to understand tokenization
